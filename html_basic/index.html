      <h1>Do Aliens Exist?</h1>
      <h2>We might not be ALONE.</h2>
      <p>Children tend to be taught that they are special and unique. But as people grow, we realise that people have a lot in common and it might not be a stretch that someone once existed that made the same choices as you have. As individuals we might understand that we are not unique and speacial, but as a collective, this is far from the case. People are skeptical that there are other intelligent lifeforms outside of our solar-system.</p>

        <h3>The meat of the matter</h3>
        <p>The lack of evidence of other intelligent lifeform alone does not explain why people express skeptisism towards this idea. People believe many things that do not have evidence supporting them. In my opinion, it is a choice to believe that we are the only intelligent lifeform that exists. A choice that may be conscious of subconscious but nevertheless one that comes from the thought that we are special and unique.</p>
